# Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds—bug reports, feature requests, and code improvements.  
Please follow the guidelines below to help us keep the process smooth.

## How to Contribute

### 🪲 Reporting Bugs

1. **Search for existing issues** before opening a new one.
2. **Provide detailed information**:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, browser, version, etc.)
   - Any relevant screenshots or logs

### 💡 Suggesting Features

1. **Check if the feature has already been requested** in the issues.
2. **Explain clearly why the feature is needed** and, if possible, suggest how it could be implemented.

### 🔧 Making Code Changes

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch.
2. **Write tests** for any new functionality or bug fixes.
3. **Submit a pull request (PR)** with:
   - A clear and descriptive title
   - A summary of changes
   - Links to related issues (if any)

## 🌳 Branching Strategy & Naming

- **Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix**.
- **Branch names should be descriptive**, e.g.:
  - `feature/add-user-auth`
  - `bugfix/fix-login-redirect`
- **Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** for commit messages.
- When ready, open a PR targeting the `main` branch.

## 🤝 Pull Request Process

- Ensure your PR is **descriptive** and links any relevant issues.
- **Run tests locally** before submitting.
- Be ready to respond to feedback or requested changes.
